Persistent snapshots for memory and adapters. Each brain region writes its
own learned weights here so progress can resume across sessions.

Additional files:
- ``token_embeddings.npy`` – semantic vectors for each tokenizer token
  (generate via ``python elarin/src/utils/token_table.py``)
- ``valence.npy`` – positive/negative phrase embeddings generated by
  ``python elarin/src/utils/valence_table.py``
- ``semantic_flow.json`` & ``semantic_flow.npy`` – obsolete transition tables
  from early experiments; safe to delete if present
